Below is a collection of resources meant to help kick start your cryptocurreny adventure! This is by no means a comprehensive guide to becoming a pro, and some of the information may be contested, but hopefully you'll learn a few things to get you going. 

# Question 1: Why does this all matter anyway?

Without delving too deep in to the history of fiat currency and questionable monetary policies behind the world's biggest banking reserve, blockchain (the underlying concept behind Bitcoin) matters as it removes the centralisation and need for trust aspect of transfers of value. [Read more: Why do Bitcoins have value?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/100314/why-do-bitcoins-have-value.asp){:target="_blank"}

Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency implementation by blockchain theorist Satoshi Nakamoto, was created with an hard limited supply of 21 million coins. These coins are distributed automatically as a reward for people "miners" who work to secure the network by processing transactions. Bitcoin on it's own wouldn't have value unless it was desired by someone else and able to be traded, but as suppliers and investors look to buy or accept Bitcoin as payment, it makes it an economic currency. (We will not be going into becoming a miner as you first need a good understanding of cryptocurrency)

Once the 21 million coins are distributed, the network will run on only transaction fees so don't worry about a great bubble "bursting", this is mostly sensationalist news spread by media or investors who stand to gain from a lower entry cost. The coins are also easily divisable into smaller units called a "Satoshi" (0.00000001 BTC)

# Question 2: How do I make money from this?

With all new technologies and "bubbles", there is a lot of money to be made from volatile markets. Investing in start-ups through ICOs or just betting on which coin/token is going to become the new leader is capable of giving you 1000% returns, it for sure beats the 2% from your bank. A lot of people in the crypto space compare this to the 'dot com era' in the early 2000's where a lot of people made money from investing in the internet pioneers of today, such as Google and Facebook. If we were to compare the current status of the cryptocurrency market to the dot com era, we are currently only in the first 3.5% of that boom. What does that mean for us? There is plenty of room for this space to grow, and with that, there are plenty of profits to be made along the way. 

# Question 3: What do I need to invest?

You'll need to have some tools in your arsenal, first of all you need a way to move your money from fiat currencies such as USD & GBP to crpytocurrenices. This is ironically the slowest part due to financial regulation, so make sure you get this going straight away and verfiy so you're not limited when the next market dip occurs!

[Coinbase*](https://www.coinbase.com/){:target="_blank"}

[CoinCorner*](https://www.coincorner.com/){:target="_blank"}

[Bittylicious](https://www.bittylicious.com/){:target="_blank"}

\*  - These have internal wallets which allow the customer to buy and store crypto currency on the website/mobile app. 

Second, you'll want to move these to either an exchange for trading, or to a wallet to hold them securely long term.


[Bittrex](https://www.bittrex.com/){:target="_blank"} - The biggest exchange to date. You will find a lot of the large cap cryptocurrencies here such as XRP, NEO and OMG.


[Binance](https://www.binance.com/){:target="_blank"} - A Chinese exchnage widely used by investors and is currently on course to take over from Bittrex as the number 1                         exchange in terms of volume. This is the exchange I use most often on a day-to-day basis. Not only do they have a                       lot of large cap currencies, but binance is perfect for new projects coming out of ICO. 


[Poloniex](https://www.poloniex.com/){:target="_blank"} - The American cousin of Bittrex         


[KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/){:target="_blank"} - Up until recently this exchange was seen as a bit of an 'underdog' incomparrison to Bittrex and Binace, but over the past 2 months we have seen expanential growth. Definitely one to look out for, and a personal favourite of mine. If you hold their own coin Kucoin shares (KCS) on the exchange, you will be paid dividends in direct relation to the trading volume of that day.

[HitBTC](https://www.hitbtc.com/){:target="_blank"}


## Mobile Apps

- Google Authenticator - Highly recommended to add that extra level of security to your exchanges.

- [Blockfolio](https://www.blockfolio.com/){:target="_blank"} - Great tool to monitor your portfolio progress, and allows you to set up price alerts.

- [Binance Exchange App](https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001507851-Binance-Android-iOS-APP-Release){:target="_blank"} - As you would expect, a mobile app for Binance exchange.

- [Telegram](https://telegram.org/apps){:target="_blank"} - Great source of information. Seen as the Whatsapp of the crypto world. * Also available on desktop.


# Question 4: Where can I learn more about the technical aspects?

Youtube is a great starting point as it provides a visual overview of the blockchain in action:

The most basic version of blockchain technology as seen in Bitcoin:

More technical items will be added soon.


# Question 5: What is an ICO?

An ICO or Initial Coin Offering is similar to the traditional IPO as it is an opportunity to get involved in a company at their early stages. An IPO is the traditional way to invest in a company which would generally allow the investor being able to make significant profits on their investment because you could purchase the stocks or equity prior to the release on stock exchanges. The only issue with IPOs is that they are limited to credible investors, which makes it virtually impossible for the everyday working man/woman to get involved. An ICO is similar in nature, as you are able to get into a crytopcurrency company pre-exchange but without the restrictions tied to it, meaning it is open to the general public. There are however some ICOs which restrict people from certain countries getting involved due to local law. These are typically the United States of America, Asia and Russia. The differece between the two is that with an IPO you are buying into a percentage of a company, whereas with an ICO you are investing in the coin or token prodeced by the company. 

# Question 6: Where can find the latest ICOs?

There are several websites to find information on the latest ICOs, but the one I use the most is https://www.coinschedule.com/. I like it because of it's clear layout, and ease of use. Every ICO have their own whitepaper, which is used to explain the fundementals of each company. Within the whitepaper you will typically find about who the company are, what they are trying to achieve and the details on how they're planning to achieve it. They will usually detail how they plan to use the funding of the ICO to scale the business to where they want it to be, and what percentages will be distributed and where. There are many strategies that people use to 'cherry pick' the best ICOs, but from what I have seen I would strongly recommend following Ian Balina on youtube and telegram (links below). Ian uses a maticulous process to quickly filter out good ICOs from bad. He documents all ICOs that he has reviewed, gives them a rating in terms of percentage and even publishes the amount of capital he is willing to invest in each project. I would not recommend to blindly follow anyone, there are lots of good reviews online so if you find an ICO that you believe will do well I would recommend doing your own due diligence by reading any whitepaper before commiting to an investment, and always go with your gut feeling.

# Question 7: Where do you get all of your information from?

Information sources varies depending on what you're investing, if you're day trading and what exchanges you operate on. 


- [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/){:target:"_blank"} * - Allows you to track almost every coin/token price, market cap and find the exchanges assosiated to a each                                coin/token. 

\* All prices found on coin market cap are an AVERAGE of all exchanges the coin/token is currently lited on.

## Youtube Channels

* [Boxmining](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxODjeUwZHk3p-7TU-IsDOA){:target:"_blank"} - Michael is a great at keeping you up to date will all of the latest news around crypto. When I first started out I found his youtube channel great for reasurace when the market took a turn for the worse. In the past few months, crypto seems to have become much more stable and less influenced by bad news, or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt) than it was in the earlier days, but it still can and will have an inpact.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxODjeUwZHk3p-7TU-IsDOA

* [Suppoman](https://www.youtube.com/user/Suppoman2011){:target:"_blank"} - His loud, animated nature is not for everyone's tastes, however I have found that he is a very knowledgable person and a great source of information for up and coming coins/tokens and ICOs. He has a very large following on youtube and has other communites on other forms of social media such as Facebook, and Twitter as well as on the crypto social media platform, Steemit.com. There are two ways he choses to conduct his daily streams, Savage Cash and Savage Crypto - Savage cash is where he talks generally about the market as a whole, suggests coins thst he is investing in and gives an overall summary of the market cap for that particual day. Savage Crypto is where he reviews usually under the radar ICO's and gives them a rating out of 5 at the end, along with whether he intends to invest, and what his strategy for the particular ICO will be. He is a notorious long time holder, and if you look back at his past videos, this strategy has paid off massively for him. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCmJln4C_CszIusbJ_MHmfQ

* [Ian Balina](https://www.youtube.com/user/Diaryofamademan){:target:"_blank"} - I speak highly of Ian in the ICOs section. With his proven track record for success at finding profitable ICOs, his strategies are sure to assit with the formation of your own ICO vetting process. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5IB8qqnIolnkuUj8a1kEQ

# Question 8: How to improve your market predictions?

One way to approach this is to apply techniques developed for the stock market, this is commonly referred to as "Technical Analysis" or "TA" for short. As much as this is backed by years of data modelling and research, you are playing with very volatile and unpredictable markets where a single bit of mis-interpreted news can cause a major panic sell among investors. Here are some good quality links to get you going:

* List of TA articles

# Question 9: How can I keep everything secure?		
 		
Security is a major concern when working within a decentralised market, it is not often that you'll simply be able to e-mail support and recover stolen funds. Here are the key points to staying stafe:		
 		
* Hardware wallet - A must have for all serious investors, this device is relatively cheap compared to having your accounts compromised. It will keep your private keys secure even if you're working from a compromised computer.		
* 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) - Enable this on your exchange accounts, the most common 2FA method is using the Google Authenticator (Install the mobile app), it will prompt for a secret code before allowing any logins on the exchanges.		
* Double checking the URL before inputting any sensitive data, common hacks occur when somebody accidentally visits a phishing and logs in. Usually the site looks 100% legit but the addresses you're depositing to are swapped to the scammers own address.		    
* Identifying scammers - This is a highly technical market, and being new people can usually convince you to share sensitive data by overloading you with information. Most commonly you'll be asked for your secret key of your online wallets, NEVER share this key, you will be handing over everything.		
 		
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If in doubt, don't be afraid to ask questions to us directly or to the Coinology telegram group.
